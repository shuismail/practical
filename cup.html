            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of 
            berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a 
            stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms 
            them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot
             water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and ha
s a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine
 content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be 
 prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or 
 already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is 
 common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or 
 enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts.
  A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or 
  coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).
